# Discrete Probability Detector in VB6
Discrete Probability Detector (DPD) is an algorithm that transforms any sequence of symbols into a transition matrix. It is able to detect the number of states from the sequence and calculate the transition probabilities between these states. This version of DPD is made in Visual Basic 6.0.
